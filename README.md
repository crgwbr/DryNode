# What's DryNode?

DryNode is a simple module for Node.js written with the goal of simplifying how Javascript libraries are handled.  It makes sharing code between client & server applications easier, allows you to serve concat'd JS libs, and dynamically load / cache libs  using the Node.js inspired `require()` function.

A longer explanation of DryNode can be found on my blog, [here <crgwbr.com>](http://crgwbr.com/details/31/keeping-things-dry-with-node-js/).

DryNode is entirely contained within dry.js, app.js and the lib folder are included to provide a usage reference.
